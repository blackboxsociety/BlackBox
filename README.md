Black Box Society
=================

Black Box Society is a project to index academic and research papers
in new and interesting ways. It's also really just a sandbox for some
framework dev i'm doing.

Install
-------

Requires SBT and Scala to be installed locally.

To run the project just run `sbt run` from the project folder, or `sbt ~reStart` for auto-recompile.

To use our LESS feature, put your LESS files in `src/main/less`, link it all up in main.less, and compile as usual.
Access your css source files from your view with `assets/css/main.less`.

You can access the dev environment [here](http://localhost:3000)

Hack
----

PRs and issue submission/participation welcome.
